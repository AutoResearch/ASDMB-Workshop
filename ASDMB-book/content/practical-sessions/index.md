# Practical Sessions

## Week 1: Basics of Automated Scientific Discovery of Mind & Brain

> Build a **fully working closed-loop experiment** with AutoRA: fit a model, run an online task with real participants, and use a theory-guided sampler to select experimental conditions.

### Overview

We’ll implement a stroop experiment using a similar model as in [Cohen & Huston](https://books.google.com/books?hl=de&lr=&id=cOAmbT3ORLcC&oi=fnd&pg=PA453&dq=cohen+%26+huston+1994&ots=nguFNK-b7W&sig=DdKsbgaUPawQbckBjMU-52ODt1M#v=onepage&q&f=false) model as the guiding theory. By the end, you’ll have a loop that:
1) proposes experimental conditions from theory
2) collects data from human participants online, and
3) updates / fits the model
