# Automated Scientific Discovery of Mind and Brain Workshop

Artificial intelligence and automation are rapidly transforming scientific practice, where they enable unprecedented
scientific discoveriesâ€“from generating novel conjectures in mathematics, to identifying novel quantum states in physics,
to predicting unprobed protein structures in chemistry. These technologies not only accelerate scientific discovery, but
also reshape how science is conducted. Although the fields of AI for science and automated scientific discovery have
primarily advanced within the natural and engineering sciences, they are now making significant inroads into psychology
and neuroscienceâ€“offering approaches for automated scientific discovery in research on mind and brain.

This two-week workshop introduces participants to emerging automated scientific discovery methods for the study of mind
and brain. Participants will gain exposure to methods for automating the design and execution of behavioral experiments,
the discovery of scientific models, and closed-loop scientific discovery.
